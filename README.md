# `krender`

Utilities to render kotlin scripts and markdown-embedded kotlin chunks with jupyter.


## Setup

Make sure that all requirements are installed

That's a bummer and we will try to reduce it over time.

## Installation

Add it to path
```
export PATH=/Users/brandl/projects/kotlin/krender/scripts
